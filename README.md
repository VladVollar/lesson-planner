# Project Status

This project is no longer maintained by the developer.  
It remains **as is**, without further updates, improvements, or bug fixes.  
You can browse the full source code in this repository.

Please note that the architecture was designed for **no more than 30–50 active users**, and it is considered **bad practice** for infrastructures operating under high load.

If you find it useful, you are free to **use the code entirely, with or without modifications**.  
Good luck!
